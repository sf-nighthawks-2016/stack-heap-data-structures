Learning objectives:
  - Understand scope and how objects are passed
  - More familiarity with common data structures
  - Problem solving using data structures



















Outline
  - disclaimer:
    - I have a tendency to teach to the people who are following along best and
       who might not even need the lecture, while leaving others behind.  If you
       feel lost or confused, or notice one of your classmates seeming confused,
       please speak up if you can so that I can address the confusion instead of
       leaving people behind.  I'm working on noticing this more but I need
       help from all of you to do better.
  - Stack vs Heap
    - call stack/scoping
    - variables on the stack, the things they reference in heap
    - drawing memory diagrams
    - object_id
    - assigning to a variable points it somewhere else
  - Data Structures
    - Arrays
    - Hashes
    - different ways to declare each
    - Nested structures
  - Choosing a data structure to fit a task
    - Markov models
  - If there's time (there probably won't be), additional data structures
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Linked Lists
    - Trees
    - Graphs (nodes and edges)
    - Least recently used cache
